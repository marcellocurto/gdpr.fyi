### Alternative Dispute Resolution in Accordance with Article 14(1) of the ODR Regulation and § 36 of the VSBG

The European Commission avails a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR), accessible at http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. It is pertinent to note, however, that I am neither obliged nor inclined to engage in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration service.
